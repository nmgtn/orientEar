{"name":"orientEar","tagline":"Ear Trainer - tech project for Tonmeister course","body":"orientEar will be a browser-based ear trainer, taking advantage of HTML5 and the Web Audio API, building upon the work done on BeaqleJS. It is being developed by me, Andy Normington, and began life as part of my Technical Project (final technical assessment) for the [Tonmeister](http://www.tonmeister.co.uk) course at the Institute of Sound Recording, University of Surrey. After graduation, I will continue development and hope to get all the core functionality running properly before too long.\r\n\r\nThe project is still in early development - a demo will be available soon. If you'd like to hear more, get in touch on GitHub or [andynormington.co.uk](http://www.andynormington.co.uk).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
